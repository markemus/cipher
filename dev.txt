A couple of days of work. So far:

2 ciphers: at_bash, caesar
Basic gui
Accepts input and parses it to decrypt using specified algorithm.

Currently cannot accept params (so caesar doesn't work). 
Also takes raw data for method names instead of using a dict to translate- bad idea!

Next: dict of available methods, then accept params

4/18/2017

Data now validated. Methods are only allowed if they're in array "methods".
Params now accepted. Can be entered either before or after method name.

Project structure complete. 

Added Vigenere cipher: however, still need decryption.

Next: add more ciphers. (inc. Vig decrypt)
